My name is Titus Peterson. I work on modern web applications. I live and play in the Pacific Northwest, near Seattle.

## Work
I build applications for small and medium businesses. That includes adding new features, configuring new servers, updating kubernetes or database configs, reviewing code, planning projects, refactoring, squashing bugs, writing tests, and optimizing processes for specific tasks. I try to keep updated well enough to understand and provide feedback for all parts of the applications I work on.

My favorite projects involve developer tooling: creating or improving the tools that other developers use to make great products. Whether I am trying to improve ergonomics, performance, automation, or  durability, I love it.

I like to be a leader on my team. Coaching new teammates, developing existing skills, providing feedback, and guiding projects are all skills I have worked hard on and take pride in.

## Play
My family loves to be on the water; you can frequently find us on paddle boards or kayaks during the summer all over the Puget Sound.

I grill on most dry days (which are admittedly not as frequent as I would like). Charcoal grilled vegetables like zucchini, potato wedges, or stuffed peppers are my favorite things to make, but a mean burger and wings are also high on the list.

During the colder months, you will find me taking classes at the YMCA or visiting family. I love the fall and winter holidays and try to celebrate all of them with family and friends.
