My name is Titus Peterson. I work on modern web applications. I live and play in the Pacific Northwest, near Seattle.

## Work
My favorite projects involve developer tooling: creating or improving the tools that other developers use to make great products. Whether I am trying to improve ergonomics, performance, automation, or  durability, I love it.

I like to be a leader on my team. Coaching new teammates, developing existing skills, providing feedback, and guiding projects are all skills I have worked hard on and take pride in.

## Play
My family loves to be on the water; you can frequently find us on paddle boards or kayaks during the summer all over the Puget Sound.

I grill on most dry days (which are admittedly not as frequent as I would like). Charcoal grilled vegetables like zucchini, potato wedges, or stuffed peppers are my favorite things to make, but a mean burger and wings are also high on the list.
